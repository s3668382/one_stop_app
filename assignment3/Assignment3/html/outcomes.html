    <div class="featureBlurb">
      <h2>Outcome:</h2>
      <p>For the feature of the player Cards/player list we expected to have it completed by the end of the time frame. in a way this feature was completed as it was functioning in the emulator with a clickable list that led to a player card with statistics of that player. however it was not put together to run with the other features. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="featureBlurb">
      <h2>Outcome:</h2>
      <p>This feature again was able to be completed to the point of a useable UI in the emulator however we wouldve liked to have a database setup so that user data could be saved however it was only completed to the point where an account could be hardcoded into the application to login and also to display account information. Along with this we also were unnable to merge it with the other features because of the different formats used for each feature.</p>

    <div class="featureBlurb">
      <h2>Outcome:</h2>
      <p>The voice assistance feature was completed to the point where you could speak into it and it would register however because this section of the app wasnt connected to other features it had nothing to search for so output was not possible.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="featureBlurb">
      <h2>Outcome:</h2>
      <p>The favorites page ran into a few complications because the code was not displaying any issues however when tested in the emulator it would crash so the feature its self never made it out of the development phase. Given more time this is something we could solve as we would have time to research a number of different possible solutions to input and test.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="featureBlurb">
      <h2>Outcome:</h2>
      <p>The burger menu encountered a number of problems however was completed to an extent where links were available and pages could be linked however once the page was clicked it would crash the app. We think this was because some things were formatted as fragments and others as activities making them incompatible. Given more time this issue definitely could have been over-come.</p>
