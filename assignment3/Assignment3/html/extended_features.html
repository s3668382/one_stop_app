    <h1>Extended Feature: Comparisons</h1>

      <h2>User Story:</h2>
      <p>As a soccer fan I want to compare the stats between two different players so that I can see how each player compares to one another and judge who is the better player.<br>
Given that the players are within the database and have enough stats, when two players are clicked and selected to be compared, then the statistics of those selected players should be displayed on the users screen side by side so that they can be compared against each other.
</p>
      <h2>Design Notes and considerations:</h2>
      <p>With the opening screen keeping it simplistic with three buttons with the two empty slots and the compare button makes it very easy for users to navigate and compare the players. <br> With a grid layout when displaying the players information, it allows for an easy distinction between whose stats are whose with the split of the screen.</p>
        
      <h2>Validation Criteria:</h2>
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Click on the compare button and have both players stats appear</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>If succeeds</td>
            <td>Both players stats will be displayed on the next screen with the players stats displayed side by side</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>If failed</td>
            <td>The display will not change and an error will have occurred with no information on the players to be displayed and have to retry comparing those players.</td>

    <div class="featureBlurb">
      <h2>User Story:</h2>
      <p>As a huge football fan, it would be my dream to meet Cristiano Ronaldo in person however due to the current pandemic it makes it practically impossible for me to do this.  I would love for someone to design a way for me to meet my hero without leaving the comfort of my living room.  <br><br> Because of the pandemic, I cannot have real life interactions with people. Creating a feature inside of an app that brings the players into a virtual world when my phone is plugged into something like a google cardboard device. This in turn should immerse me into a world where that player is visible as if he is really there.</p>
      <h2>Design Notes and considerations:</h2>
      <p>-To open the VR feature the user will have to navigate to the player card of their choosing and click upon the VR button that can be found in the top right<br><br>-Unsure of if in the app we will have the player picture and stats remain static or have them follow the users movements. The likely outcome will probably be whatever the team gets working first</p>
      <h2>Validation Criteria:</h2>
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Task</th>

        <tr>
            <td>If succeeds</td>
            <td>The user will be able to view the player in a virtual enivronment along with some picked at stats</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>If failed</td>
            <td>if the fucntion fails to initiate the user will be stuck on the player cards page wondering why the button does nothing</td>
