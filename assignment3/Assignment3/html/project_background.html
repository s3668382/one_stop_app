    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
        <p>What motivated our group to choose such a project was because of how sports such as soccer were cancelled due to the circumstances which have affected the world. Due to this reason we had come up with the idea to create and design an application where people would be able to see the statistics of soccer teams and players using Virtual Reality (VR). We believe that since people were/are unable to expereience these matches, by using VR it would provide a similar and intriguing experience for users as it would make it seem as if they were looking at a player in person.</p>
        
    <h1>Aim and Goals</h1>
        <h2>Aim:</h2>
        <p>In this time, the era of mobile devices, we aim to bring our target audience their favorite sport direct to their phones. Having an application where you can compare players, watch games, and save your favorite players statistics anywhere you go.</p>
        
        <h2>Goal 1:</h2>
        <p>We aim to have a live streaming feature of our application where you can view any game that is being played in any major league around the world. This will give users the opportunity to enjoy their favorite sports where they usually couldnt such as; on the train to work, or sitting in the waiting room waiting for an appointment.</p>
        
        <h2>Goal 2:</h2>
        <p>We also wish to incorporate a fully functional list that allows you to save your favorite players and view their statistics for every season they have ever played, past or present.</p>
        
        <h2>Goal 3:</h2>
        <p>Our third goal is to implement the ability to compare these players with eachother. showing a side by side view of the players career or match statistics. This would allow the users to compare players they wish to choose for their FIFA teams or even their fantasy football teams that they have. </p>
        
    <h1>Scope</h1>
        
        <p>Our outcomes consisted of our MVF's: Account page, Favorites Page, Player list, Voice Assitance, and the Burger menu. As a whole our application is not put together as we encounted a few issues when attempting to merge the code. However, each individual MVF is working on its own in the emulator provided in the android studio application.</p>
