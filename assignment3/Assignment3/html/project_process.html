        <p>The main point that sticks out to me is that communication and working in tandem is probably the most important part to having a successful group project, this was something that I felt we all, including myself, lacked at crucial times during the semester. Realising that we were in trouble the group communication ramped up towards the end of the semester and we had more frequent meetings to try and get something done. <br> Even though it felt like sometimes we were asking our mentor enough questions I think we could have asked more, specifically about any resources he might be able to recommend. <br> If I had to give advice to groups about to make an app is that you should start with a base and work off of that or at least discuss the format you’re going to be using to create the activities(like fragments or appcompatactivity). This is because it can be a nightmare to bring features made separately together unless you’re more experienced.</p>
