        <h1>Nathan Kaspers </h1>
        
        <p>This semester i have found that communication is key when working in a group. This is something i found we did not do very well. The group was constantly setting up meetings but there was always someone not present and usually only the same 2 or 3 people talking or giving ideas throughout and this is something we needed to work on. The comments from our mentor did not really help the process as most of the time he would come in to meetings and would misunderstand what our app actually was despite us explaining exactly what it was we were doing. this made up for a lot of lost time and unhelpful comments. If I was to start again i would definitely look at starting the coding process a lot earlier and stick to the timetable a lot more than what I did. The advice I would give to a similar group would be communicate. Communication is key and without it you find yourself and the rest of the group in a bit of a spiral and trying to play catch up for the entire length of the project. </p>

        <p>The main point that sticks out to me is that communication and working in tandem is probably the most important part to having a successful group project, this was something that I felt we all, including myself, lacked at crucial times during the semester. Realising that we were in trouble the group communication ramped up towards the end of the semester and we had more frequent meetings to try and get something done. <br> Even though it felt like sometimes we were asking our mentor enough questions I think we could have asked more, specifically about any resources he might be able to recommend. <br> If I had to give advice to groups about to make an app is that you should start with a base and work off of that or at least discuss the format you’re going to be using to create the activities(like fragments or appcompatactivity). This is because it can be a nightmare to bring features made separately together unless you’re more experienced.</p>

        <p>What I had learned about group projects was how important communication is because, without it, the group wouldn't be able to know exactly what needs to be done. what worked in our group was how often we would communicate with each other about issues or tasks that needed to be done for the assignment. What hadn't worked well was how each of us had made our individual code for different features of the app. This was a problem because it was difficult to link the codes together. I used my mentor to help me get an idea of what I could be doing better. The lecturer had also helped me understand what could be done better. Our group processes for communication was either to text each other or schedule a meeting using Microsoft Teams. It was pretty effective as someone would reply to a message in a short amount of time. The group has been communicating the same way since the start of the semester so there weren't any changes. The most important aspect of organising a project would be communication because it's the only way for others to know if there is anything that needs to be done. I don't think there would be anything that I'd do differently if I were to start again because I believe that the group was able to balance out everything well due to how we communicated. Advice that I would give to a group embarking on a similar project is to plan out how things are going to be done and to constantly communicate with the group.</p>
