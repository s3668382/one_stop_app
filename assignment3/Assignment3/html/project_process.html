        <h1>Nathan Kaspers </h1>
        
        <p>This semester i have found that communication is key when working in a group. This is something i found we did not do very well. The group was constantly setting up meetings but there was always someone not present and usually only the same 2 or 3 people talking or giving ideas throughout and this is something we needed to work on. The comments from our mentor did not really help the process as most of the time he would come in to meetings and would misunderstand what our app actually was despite us explaining exactly what it was we were doing. this made up for a lot of lost time and unhelpful comments. If I was to start again i would definitely look at starting the coding process a lot earlier and stick to the timetable a lot more than what I did. The advice I would give to a similar group would be communicate. Communication is key and without it you find yourself and the rest of the group in a bit of a spiral and trying to play catch up for the entire length of the project. </p>
        
        <h1>Tom Bakker </h1>
        
        <p>The main point that sticks out to me is that communication and working in tandem is probably the most important part to having a successful group project, this was something that I felt we all, including myself, lacked at crucial times during the semester. Realising that we were in trouble the group communication ramped up towards the end of the semester and we had more frequent meetings to try and get something done. <br> Even though it felt like sometimes we were asking our mentor enough questions I think we could have asked more, specifically about any resources he might be able to recommend. <br> If I had to give advice to groups about to make an app is that you should start with a base and work off of that or at least discuss the format you’re going to be using to create the activities(like fragments or appcompatactivity). This is because it can be a nightmare to bring features made separately together unless you’re more experienced.</p>
        
        <h1>Matthew Falzon </h1>
        
        <p>I learned that in group projects having each member contribute evenly and discuss when every member can be available helps the group understand what is going on within the project leaving no one behind. What worked well was our decision-making having tasks given to those who are capable or a willing to complete those tasks and having the group all understand the groups different strengths and weaknesses. What did not work well was the communication with many occasions having people absent or people’s mics not working made it difficult. I did not make much use of the mentor as having the weekly meetings and making sure that we were achieving our goals and that they were reasonable. Our group process of communication was through Teams, were we would arrange times to meet during the week and all come together at those agreed times to discuss what needs to be done next. The most important aspect of organising a project like this one is communication. Having all members of your group talking and telling where they are at, and what they are doing makes it easy for the rest of the group to know who is doing what and what needs to be done. If we were to start again, I would create more meetings during a week just so everyone knows what is going on and no one falls behind because they may have missed one of the previous meetings. The advice I would give to a group starting a similar project would be to have everyone contribute to the project you are making so that it is interesting to everyone involved.</p>

        <p>What I had learned in this semster is that communication is very important in a group. I think this was something we did not do well, especially for me, because I found out that I don't talk much in the meeting. If i can start the project again, I think I should talk a bit more in the group meeting and give ideas about the assignment. If i have to give advice to other group, I would tell them to communicate with their group more. </p>
        
        <h1>John Usaraga</h1>
        
        <p>What I had learned about group projects was how important communication is because, without it, the group wouldn't be able to know exactly what needs to be done. what worked in our group was how often we would communicate with each other about issues or tasks that needed to be done for the assignment. What hadn't worked well was how each of us had made our individual code for different features of the app. This was a problem because it was difficult to link the codes together. I used my mentor to help me get an idea of what I could be doing better. The lecturer had also helped me understand what could be done better. Our group processes for communication was either to text each other or schedule a meeting using Microsoft Teams. It was pretty effective as someone would reply to a message in a short amount of time. The group has been communicating the same way since the start of the semester so there weren't any changes. The most important aspect of organising a project would be communication because it's the only way for others to know if there is anything that needs to be done. I don't think there would be anything that I'd do differently if I were to start again because I believe that the group was able to balance out everything well due to how we communicated. Advice that I would give to a group embarking on a similar project is to plan out how things are going to be done and to constantly communicate with the group.</p>

        <p>we have planned to test our app in these first steps and all comment from the user is variable. We use Figma to get the test from users by letting them using the prototype. Besides, we also demo our project with classmates in tutorials.
