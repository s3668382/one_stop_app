      <h2>User Story:</h2>
      <p>As a soccer fan, I have always wanted an app where I can see the teams and players I follow with ease as it takes quite a bit of time to search for these things as I have trouble understanding how to use most applications. Due to my lack of knowledge on how to use applications, I would appreciate it if someone were to create an app with a feature that allows you to 'like' or 'favourite' any soccer teams and players you follow and have them display them all together on an easily accessible page. This should help me see the soccer teams and players I love with ease, reducing the amount of time I usually spend when searching for them specifically.</p>
      <h2>Design Notes and considerations:</h2>
      <p>To maintain the simple design of the app, I made it so that only the favourited teams would display and any more information relating to the teams would display if the user clicks on it/p>
        <h2>Validation Criteria:</h2>
