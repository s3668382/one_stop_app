    <h1>Description</h1>
    
        <p>Our project began as we had a group call with all team members of this project, introducing and getting to know each other. When one of our members shared that they had interest for football (soccer) it gave our group the idea to create an app that involved our members interest to track the stats of players in a new way. We had our idea thought of and we began planning what we wanted the app to do with some research of similar apps within the market. We encountered our first of few dead ends with our mentor ABM Russel informing us that our app may need to add a few features so that the app becomes unique instead of what the rest of market already offers suggesting to implement VR, comparisons and voice assistance. With these features added we began planning the design with everyone creating a design of the home page and merging the best two to create our new home page. Once designed and everyone designed their own pages, we moved onto creating the application. The next obstacle was using Android studio. With no prior experience from any of members learning making the application was challenging but with a little practise all members had a basic understanding on how to make their part of the application. With everyone’s part of the application being completed it was time we had to put everyone’s work together however, we hit another dead end with merging all the work we had completed. This became very challenging and we were not successful in putting all the work together, however each part works individually creating our app. All records of work will be found on the appendix page which includes Github use, Trello use, AWS use, Teams Meetings, and more.</p>
        
    <h1>Scope creep/Windfall</h1>
        
        <p>Originally, we had planned out to complete all code for the app a few days before the due date of the assignment, the remaining time would be used to do the report. Although this was the case, it had taken us longer to complete the code as it was difficult to link all the codes together and get them to work. An example of this was John's code. Despite there being no known errors in the code, whenever it was run on an emulator it would crash and we were unable to see the code work. Due to this, we were unable to integrate it into the main code. If we had the time to solve this issue again, then we would try other ways to think of other ways to fix this.</p>
        <p>We didn't discover a quicker way to achieve an aspect of our project to make our estimation 'over-generous' as we had completed our tasks close to what he had estimated it to be completed by.</p>
        
    <h1>Progress</h1>
        
        <p>Our group didn't really adhere to the timetable created in assignment 1, at least not the starting times for features however we got the separate features finished close to our original estimates. for example the <a href="https://trello.com/c/WgXHCbQb">Burger Menu</a>
        was completed well before the due date we had assigned to it on the trello card, however, other things that we had planned to finish like the extended viable feature <a href="https://trello.com/c/xOIyua8K">VR</a> ended up being left to the wayside in favour of ironing out kinks in other features that were more important.
        You can see in our meetings that you can find on the <a href="appendix.html">appendix</a> page that we really ramped up the intesity of work and frequency of meetings once we realised we were falling behind.
        </p>
        
    <h1>Testing</h1>
        
        <p>we have planned to test our app in these first steps and all comment from the user is variable. We use Figma to get the test from users by letting them using the prototype. Besides, we also demo our project with classmates in tutorials.

    <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
        <p>We host our project on GitHub, so everyone can work on the same project. We use figma to design the prototype of the app. Our app is an android based app so, we use the android studio to make our app. </p>
