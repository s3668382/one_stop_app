    <h1>Scope creep/Windfall</h1>
        
        <p>Originally, we had planned out to complete all code for the app a few days before the due date of the assignment, the remaining time would be used to do the report. Although this was the case, it had taken us longer to complete the code as it was difficult to link all the codes together and get them to work. An example of this was John's code. Despite there being no known errors in the code, whenever it was run on an emulator it would crash and we were unable to see the code work. Due to this, we were unable to integrate it into the main code. If we had the time to solve this issue again, then we would try other ways to think of other ways to fix this.</p>
        <p>We didn't discover a quicker way to achieve an aspect of our project to make our estimation 'over-generous' as we had completed our tasks close to what he had estimated it to be completed by.</p>
        
    <h1>Progress</h1>
        
        <p>Our group didn't really adhere to the timetable created in assignment 1, at least not the starting times for features however we got the separate features finished close to our original estimates. for example the <a href="https://trello.com/c/WgXHCbQb">Burger Menu</a>
        was completed well before the due date we had assigned to it on the trello card, however, other things that we had planned to finish like the extended viable feature <a href="https://trello.com/c/xOIyua8K">VR</a> ended up being left to the wayside in favour of ironing out kinks in other features that were more important.
