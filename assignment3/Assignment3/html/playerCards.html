      <h2>User Story:</h2>
      <p>As a soccer Fan, I really want an application that can tell me how well my favourite players are doing so that I am able to make the best selection for my fantasy football league I’m having with my friends. <br><br> Given that fantasy football relies on players certain players form I would love for an app to present me with a list of players for me to select and search through that can give me a list of important statistics such as, how many goals they’ve scored, how many minutes they’ve played, how many cards they’ve gotten and how many assists. All of these will then help me to choose who is best to put in my fantasy league team. </p>
      <h2>Design Notes and considerations:</h2>
      <p>When creating the player card section I decided to put a simplified statistic section upon clicking the player with an option to look at an advanced set of stats using the more button located next to the simplified statistics.</p>
      <h2>Validation Criteria:</h2>
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Click on Cristiano Ronaldo to bring up the advanced statistics</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>If succeeds</td>
            <td>If succeeds the user should have clicked the more button after clicking on Ronaldo in the list and the new page should have opened. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>If failed</td>
            <td>If the function failed the user will still be on the player list screen and repetitive clicking should do nothing. </td>
        </tr> 
      </table>
