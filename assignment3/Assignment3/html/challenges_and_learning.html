        <p>Previously when I’ve had to learn something like a new Java concept it was within a structured environment, however when having to learn it on my own and seek my own resources I really struggled with it. As a group I think we’ve all had issues with communication at varying times which I think we’ve realised at the tail end of the semester, this lead to us having more frequent meetings for group discussions and updates.<br> Once we’d decided on a project platform I realised that it would be challenging, I attempted to overcome these issues with a bit of research and getting started on work early but it had little success in the end as I still failed to get the VR working.<br> Our plans changed coming from assignment 2 into assignment 3 as people changed the features they were working on. I also stopped working on VR at the start of week 11 to try and help iron out issues with the app as a whole, however we still failed to get full integration of everyone’s features together. In hindsight I think we should have all started with a base instead of splitting off and trying to bring it all together at the end.</p>
