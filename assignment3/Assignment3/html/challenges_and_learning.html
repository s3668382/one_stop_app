        <p>Throughout this project the only thing that i have genuinely found easy was the creation of the prototype using the figma program. The group dynamic and the lack of cummincation has stretched us and made most aspects of the project very difficult to complete one of these being the joining of the MVF's to create one smooth application.<br> When starting the work on the actual coding of the app i realised that my knowledge of java was not going to be as useful as i thought because android studio used its own library that i was very unfamiliar with. this led to me going to youtube to watch multiple videos to try and get a better understanding. <br> Our original plan for this project was changed dramatically when we encounted a number of coding issues not previously accounted for. I know that I thought the coding of the app would be easy but I was wrong and it took a lot more skill and research to complete, with the app still not as one running application at the end.</p>

        <p>Previously when I’ve had to learn something like a new Java concept it was within a structured environment, however when having to learn it on my own and seek my own resources I really struggled with it. As a group I think we’ve all had issues with communication at varying times which I think we’ve realised at the tail end of the semester, this lead to us having more frequent meetings for group discussions and updates.<br> Once we’d decided on a project platform I realised that it would be challenging, I attempted to overcome these issues with a bit of research and getting started on work early but it had little success in the end as I still failed to get the VR working.<br> Our plans changed coming from assignment 2 into assignment 3 as people changed the features they were working on. I also stopped working on VR at the start of week 11 because I didn’t fully understand the texture wrapping that was required in the Google provided tutorial and other resources offered little help, I decided to, instead of finishing the VR that my time would be better spent trying to help iron out issues with the app as a whole, however we still failed to get full integration of everyone’s features together. In hindsight I think we should have all started with a base instead of splitting off and trying to bring it all together at the end.</p>

        <p>Things that I found easy to do when working on this project was being able to communicate with the other members of the group. This was because of how well we were able to plan out and address certain topics about our project. What I had found difficult was creating the code for the application as I had no knowledge of creating the code before this assignment. What was unexpected was that I was able to write the code for the feature that I was assigned to do. A way that I have been stretched is that I had to learn how to write code for an app without having any prior knowledge of how to do so. A challenge which I was expecting was being able to write my code for the app as I had no prior knowledge of how to do it. To address this issue, I had watched videos on Youtube and had searched about how to use android studio on Google. In the end, I was able to finish my code, however, we were unable to link it to the main app due to an unknown error where the emulator would crash whenever the code was run. A new skill which i have learned is how to write code for an application using 'Android Studio'. My plan for this project has always remained the same which was to get all my work done in time. I did encounter issues when attempting to use an emulator for my code as the emulator itself was not working. Due to this, I was unable to add my code into the final application. Something i would do differently if I had the time to do it is to try out more ways to resolve this issue. I would say my timetable was pretty realistic because of how long it took me to do my tasks compared to the amount of time that planned out in the timetable. When using 'Android Studio' to create a feature for the application, it had worked out as expected, however, an unanticipated event which had affected my progress was that I was not able to use an emulator to actually test out the code itself. Due to this, it had made it hard for me to know whether or not the code had worked. This was overcome as I was able to get help from my group to run my code and see whether or not it had worked.</p>
